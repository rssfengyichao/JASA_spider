To avoid spurious results that could follow from the extensive data-dredging involved in finding \u201cgood-fitting\u201d dividend models, only half of the available firms are used in the original search, the remaining firms serving as a check on the findings. In addition, since the models tested are autoregressive, their statistical properties cannot always be evaluated analytically. This problem is surmounted to some extent by using simulations to study the results and conclusions obtained from the data for individual firms. The novelty in this use of simulations is that they are directed towards checking specific empirical results rather than establishing the properties of some general model. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the regression analysis and from the simulations are again checked by using the various models to predict dividend changes for a new year of data. The coherence in the results obtained with these various tests justifies strong conclusions with respect to the \u201cbest\u201d dividend models and their properties."], ["Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Estimation of Transition Probabilities", "In this paper, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are presented for estimating transition probabilities when data in the form of aggregated proportions are available.

It is pointed out that the use of definitions which coincide with what seem to be the traditional notions of simple random sampling, and post-stratification (stratification after sampling) leads to the solution of such riddles which appear in the more recent theory as the failure of the likelihood principle to sanction any non-trivial inference whatever. In particular, a general method of maximum likelihood is shown to lead to new estimates for the population mean when the three aforementioned sampling plans are employed. Thus objective likelihood inference from sample to population is seen in these instances to be possible if and only if randomization is employed in the selection of the sample.

The article describes two methods of changing the measures of sizes without introducing a bias in the estimation procedure. They result in the reduction of the variance of sample take, and, in the illustrative material presented, result in varying degrees of overlap before and after the changes of sizes. These methods are particularly applicable to systematic samples where repetitive panel operations are employed, for example, as in the Canadian Labour Force Survey. In the Canadian Labour Force Survey, a self-weighting sample is selected in two to four stages, often by means of systematic sampling with probability proportional to size, the size being Census or field counts of persons or dwellings. This results in a sample which provides population estimates of employment and unemployment with sufficient accuracy for the cost provided at the provincial and national levels and a sample which can be easily maintained for long periods of time. Unfortunately, the so-called measures of size used in the systematic samples become out of date because of uneven growth in the first stage units. N. Keyfitz [3] and I. P. Fellegi [2] have dealt effectively with methods of adjusting measures of size in the case where one or two units are selected at random without replacement with probability proportional to size so that as few new units need be selected as possible.

The difference between the log of the estimated variance of the process and the log of the estimated innovation variance is used as a test for white noise. It is shown that this test is equivalent to Bartlett's test for homogeneity of variances applied to the periodogram without grouping and the asymptotic properties are derived."], [null, null], ["Estimation of Parameters in the Multivariate Normal Distribution with Missing Observations", "In this paper a method is developed for estimating the parameters in the multivariate normal distribution in which the missing observavations are not restricted to follow certain patterns as in most previous papers. The large sample properties of the estimators are discussed. Equivalence with maximum likelihood estimators has been established for a subclass of problems. The results of some simulation studies are provided to support the theoretical development."], ["Bayesian Estimation of Means for the Random Effect Model", null], ["Grouping Estimators on Heteroscedastic Data", "This paper gives numerical comparisons of the efficiency of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Grouping Estimators in simple linear regression.

This analysis is generalized here to a class of nonlinear utility functions by defining and interrelating minimum selling and maximum buying prices for decisions (section 2), certainty equivalents of uncertain costs of information (section 3), values of information (section 4), and net gains of information (section 5).

The Chi-square criterion is expressed in terms of simple orthonormal functions; and hence the parameter of noncentrality is expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient and class boundaries [formula (13)]. This formula is compared with the formula of Eisenhart [2] giving the limiting form of the parameter of noncentrality as the number of classes is indefinitely increased. It is found that no significant increase in power can be achieved by taking a number of classes greater than 20; and even a number as small as 12 is sufficient. Two choices of classes are compared, namely, equal class-probability (suggested by Mann and Wald [6]) and equal class-width of 0.4 standard deviation (suggested by Hamdan [4]). It is found that the latter choice is more powerful."], ["Bias In Multinomial Classification", null], [null, null], ["The Inversion of Cumulant Operators for Power-Series Distributions, and the Approximate Stabilization of Variance by Transformations", null], ["Generalized Hyperbolic Secant Distributions", null], ["Robustness of Sum of Squared Ranks Test", null], ["An Investigation into the Small Sample Properties of a Two Sample Test of Lehmann's", null], ["Recursive Generation of the Distribution of Several Non-Parametric Test Statistics Under Censoring", "The exact distributions of several non-parametric test statistics based on (usually) censored samples are obtained recursively under certain non-parametric classes of alternatives."], ["Technology, Economic Growth and Public Policy, Richard R.
