Other useful techniques are also summarized. The methods are then applied to the analysis of stock-market returns and air traffic flows. These two examples are studied in detail to illustrate the use of the proposed method compared to other available techniques. The empirical examples also illuminate the importance of the treatment of stochastic instability in statistical applications."], ["Small-Sample Properties of Nonlinear Least Squares and Maximum Likelihood Estimators in the Context of Autocorrelated Errors", "Rao and Griliches (1969) compared several methods of parameter estimation in models having autocorrelated errors. They concluded that nonlinear least squares estimators were not superior to two-stage linear estimators. This study partially replicates the Rao and Griliches Monte Carlo simulation and, in addition, examines the maximum likelihood estimator as a possible competitor. The simulation results are not consistent with those of Rao and Griliches; the small-sample efficiency of nonlinear and maximum likelihood estimators appears to be consistently high and thus reverses some of Rao and Griliches's conclusions."], [null, "The robustness of Hotelling's one- and two-sample tests is investigated by Monte Carlo methods. Samples are presented from uniform, exponential, and lognormal distributions.

Cloud seeding experiments, including Project Whitetop, provide a background for illustrating some of the statistical issues in meteorological field experimentation and for exposing some of the difficulties that can arise when meteorologists and statisticians look at the same experiments from different points of view.

Several examples are given which demonstrate the convenience of this hybrid approach. The Zippin-Armitage method for dealing with incomplete survival information is generalized. A simple expression is obtained for the survival curve given nonparametric estimators of (1) the probability density of survival times for patients who have died, and (2) the probability density of known survival times for patients still alive.

Outliers are discussed briefly, and an example is presented."], ["The Asymptotic Mean Squared Error of Multistep Prediction from the Regression Model with Autoregressive Errors", "The asymptotic prediction mean squared error is derived for the regression model with autoregressive errors. The results cover the cases where future values of the exogenous variables are known, where some exogenous variables are predicted from autoregressive processes, and where lagged endogenous variables are included in the model.
