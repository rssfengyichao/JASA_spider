The chance mechanism of carcinogenesis and the chance mechanism behind the varying properties of the comets in the Solar System exemplify the subjects of dynamic indeterministic studies. One might hazard the assertion that every serious contemporary study is a study of the chance mechanism behind some phenomena. The statistical and probabilistic tool in such studies is the theory of stochastic processes, now involving many unsolved problems. In order that the applied statistician be in a position to cooperate effectively with the modern experimental scientist, the theoretical equipment of the statistician must include familiarity and capability of dealing with stochastic processes."], ["Market Growth, Company Diversification and Product Concentration 1947\u20131954", "The hypothesis that market growth leads to reduced sellers' concentration is presented and briefly elaborated. Then, after an evaluation of the data, they are used to make a direct and an indirect test of the hypothesis. In the direct test, a negative relationship is found between concentration change and market growth, both for aggregate changes and for those of individual markets. In the indirect test concentration change is found to be related to the increasing importance of multi-product plants in a fashion that implies that the increased diversification of companies, rather than that of their plants alone, has brought lower levels of product concentration. Both tests lend positive though not conclusive support to the hypothesis."], ["On Finite Sample Distributions of Generalized Classical Linear Identifiability Test Statistics", null], ["A Note on the Limiting Relative Efficiency of the Wald Sequential Probability Ratio Test", null], ["Internal Migration Statistics for the United States", null], ["Bivariate Exponential Distributions", "In the second distribution (3.4) the conditional expectation of one variable increases or decreases with increasing values of the other variable depending on the sign of the correlation.

The varying rates of occurrence reflect the differential impacts of economic vairables and social change. This study indicates that until better data are available, forecasts of households will have to rely primarily upon judgment. This can be gained from an analysis of past data plus information carried over from related series which have more frequent observations. No single statistical function can be found to express the manner in which the Census estimates of households have moved. This apparent lack of correlation reflects the need to average several years' data to obtain accuracy. It also stems from relatively few past observations, and the likelihood that significant structural shifts have occurred and have altered past economic relationships."], ["A Statistical Investigation of the Industrialization Controversy", "Whether trade of the industrial countries with the non-industrial countries declines in an industrializing world has always been a controversial question. The present paper examines this controversy with reference to events in the postwar period. The validity of the findings is tested under alternative classifications of an industrial area and in terms of current value and deflated value figures. Recent changes in the commodity composition of exports of both areas are then noted. The main finding is that the progressing industrialization in the postwar years did not unfavorably affect the volume of exports of the industrial area, although it did change, to some extent, the direction and composition of the international commodity flows. However, certain conditions in the postwar period do not allow us to assume that we can resolve the controversy in question."], ["Optimal Properties of Exponentially Weighted Forecasts", null], ["Large-Sample Covariance Analysis when the Control Variable is Fallible", "When the control variable contains errors of measurement, the usual analysis of covariance fails to adjust adequately for initial differences between groups.

Reported growth was augmented by broadening of census definitions, improvement of procedures, wider awareness of women's employment, increasing willingness to report women's work, and the shift from self-employment and homework to wage and salary employment away from home. Internal checks and comparisons with other enumerations suggest serious undercount of women workers by earlier censuses.

However, the number of permitted observations may be less than the number of strata formed by the usual double stratification technique. A method which will permit estimation in these cases is presented. Both biased and unbiased estimators are considered. It is shown that if the stratification effects are additive in the analysis-of-variance sense the method is particularly effective. Also, if the substrata sizes (formed from the two-way classification of the population according to the stratifying criteria) are proportional to the product of the corresponding one-way strata sizes, the possible loss in efficiency compared to single stratification is trivial. Even in populations in which substrata disproportion is great one can still use the method effectively by employing a method of allocating, with certainty, some of the sample observations to the substrata.
