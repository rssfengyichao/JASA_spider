It is a common practice to plot the observations of a sample on this paper to obtain a graphical check for normality or to obtain a graphical estimate of the mean and variance of the population. Textbooks, however, are not very specific about methods for plotting, for, although the ordered observations are plotted along the abscissa, some uncertainties about the corresponding ordinates are left unresolved. The purpose of this paper is to indicate, with a special example, that any graphical technique should depend to a large extent on the purpose for which the graph is drawn. In particular, it presents tables covering sample sizes up to 10, for selecting the ordinates on normal probability paper so as to obtain \u201coptimum\u201d graphical estimates of the mean \u03b6 and the standard deviation \u03c3 of a normal distribution.

An analysis of data on failures of four types of business in Poughkeepsie, New York, from 1844 to 1926 [2] confirms this expectation.

Some experiences would seem to indicate that retirement causes higher mortality than is standard for the ages concerned. Frequently, however, such conclusions are not warranted because the individuals who do retire under voluntary provisions tend to be those who are in poor health. When retirement is compulsory, such experience as is available does not indicate high mortality but this is probably, at least in part, due to the fact that many quite healthy workers are among the retired group in contrast with the situation under plans having voluntary retirement. There is no conclusive data currently on hand to indicate for a given group of individuals what the effect of retirement on mortality really is depending upon whether similar groups of individuals could retire or could continue working."], ["Sampling Control of Literacy Data*", null], ["Response Errors in Estimating the Value of Homes*", "In the 1950 Survey of Consumer Finances home owners were asked to estimate the market value of their houses. Estimates for these same homes were later made by professional appraisers. These two estimates for each of 568 homes comprise the data analyzed here. The proportion of discrepancies between the two estimates is great: only 37 per cent of the estimates by respondents are within plus or minus 10 per cent of the appraisers' estimates. However, the errors tend to be offsetting, and in none of the ten price classes used is the difference in the relative frequencies for owners and appraisers statistically significant. Similarly, although the root-mean-square difference between the two measurements is high (an average of $3,100), the mean of the respondents' estimates is only $350 higher than the mean of $9,200 for the appraisers' estimates. The amount of variability is found to be rather similar for several sub-populations. However, for houses worth over $10,000 the mean-square difference between the measurements is found to increase with the value of the home.
