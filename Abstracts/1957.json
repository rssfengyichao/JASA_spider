One way of formulating this requirement mathematically is given and numerical recommendations are made for use when the variate is normally distributed."], ["Use of Dummy Variables in Regression Equations", "The use of dummy variables requires the imposition of additional constraints on the parameters of regression equations if determinate estimates are to be obtained. Among the possible constraints the most useful are (a) to set the constant term of the equation to zero, or (b) to omit one of the dummy variables from the equation. In working with a single system of classes either constraint can be used, and results from the application of one are readily derived from those obtained from the other. If several systems of classes are involved the best procedure is to delete one dummy variable from each system."], ["Fitting a Straight Line to Certain Types of Cumulative Data", "Many situations giving rise to linear data involve measurements made at progressive stages of a physical or chemical process carried out on the same subject of experimentation. In such cases, the experimental errors include cumulative components related to the process, and the errors corresponding to different points on the line are not independent. Failure to take such cumulation of errors into account results in serious underestimation of the standard error of the estimated rate of the process. The standard errors and correlations of the residuals from regression are derived both for situations involving cumulative and independent errors. The differences between the two situations are striking and may be used as a basis for judging which of the two types of error is predominant in a given case. The procedure is illustrated by means of the data obtained in an experiment in physical optics."], ["Estimating the Logistic Curve", null], ["Corrigenda", null], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Publications Received", null], ["Leading American Statisticians in the Nineteenth Century", null], ["Statistics and Science", " "], ["Nonparametric Statistics", " "], [null, null], ["A Problem in Life Testing", null], ["Historical Notes on the Wilcoxon Unpaired Two-Sample Test", null], ["Summaries of Papers Delivered at the 116th Annual Meeting of the American Statistical Association in Detroit, September 7\u201310, 1956", null], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Publications Received", null], ["Errors of the Third Kind in Statistical Consulting", "Because graduate students in statistics are given little, if any, preparation for actual consulting, they are prone, particularly in their early years, to commit errors of the third kind, many of which could be avoided if the students were properly trained.

This measure is of value to economists concerned with family budgets, and to manufacturers and distributors interested in knowing how often the consumer will enter the market.

A generalization of the design to the case in which the rows, columns and treatments represented in the experiment are samples from populations of rows, columns and treatments respectively is studied. A possible frame of reference for the interpretation of the experimental results is described. The leads to what is termed a \u201cpopulation model,\u201d various population parameters, means and components of variation which are of interest to the experimenter. No assumptions are made about additivity of experimental units and treatments. Results on expectations of mean squares in the analysis of variance are given in terms of quantities (denoted by [Sgrave]'s) which result in a concise description and in terms of the components of variation. Biases in the estimation of components of variation by means of the analysis of variance are discussed and assessed. Comparisons of randomized block designs and Latin square designs are given for the general case of non-additive treatments for random, mixed, or fixed population of rows and columns. A generalization of the design is discussed. The mathematical machinery which is used to derive the results is presented briefly. Finally linear estimates and errors of estimates are discussed. One main conclusion of the study is that the Latin square analysis of variance may overestimate the error of treatment comparisons and underestimate the component of variation associated with treatment main effects."], ["Transformations to Normality Using Fractional Powers of the Variable", null], ["Linear Transformation to a Set of Stochastically Dependent Normal Variables", "It is the purpose of this paper to present a method which will enable the construction of a set of stochastically dependent normal variables from a set of independent normal variables."], ["The Regions of Unimodality and Positivity in the Abbreviated Edgeworth and Gram-Charlier Series", null], ["The President's Economic Report", " "], ["Statistical Abstracts", null], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Publications Received", null], ["American Statistical Association Report of the Board of Directors, 1956", null], ["Statistical Frontiers", " "], ["A Short-Cut Graphic Method for Fitting the best Straight Line to a Series of Points According to the Criterion of Least Squares", " "], ["Rapid Analysis of 2 \u00d7 2 Tables", "In many practical applications, especially when a long question schedule is given to two (or more) series of individuals, the computation of a large number of chi-square tests may become burdensome.
