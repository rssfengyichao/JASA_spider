For long-range projections, the paper argues that a program-by-program analysis of budgetary issues and trends is superior to mechanical projection of expenditures as a function of gross national product. For a one-year projection, it is pointed out that the Federal budget should be just a starting point for the forecaster because the expenditure estimates in the official annual budget document cannot be viewed as forecasts. The reasons for this include: the long lead-time required in the preparation of the budget; the dependence of some program results on economic and weather conditions that can change rapidly; and the fact that by its very nature the budget necessarily reflects Presidential policy recommendations rather than a detached forecast of the final results of legislative and executive branch actions. For quarterly and monthly forecasts, a program-by-program method of appraising expenditure trends is also advised."], ["Analysis of Vital Statistics by Census Tract", "This report presents the results of a questionnaire survey of official health agencies on the current uses of census tract data with special reference to studies of health as related to socioeconomic status. Interesting studies are now being conducted, but for health program purposes a need is seen for a further extension of use of census tract data. Comparison of mortality, for example, of the population in areas of equal socioeconomic status in the various cities across the country offers new possibilities in the evaluation of the effects of such as air pollution and climate on mortality."], ["A Check on Gross Errors in Certain Variance Computations", "In stratified samples, the variance of ratio estimates often includes the variance of the variable used for stratification.

This study formulates naturally motivated estimates of the Circular Probable Error (CEP), an extensively used figure of merit.

This study is an attempt to bring together the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors by grafting onto a master model of the total economy a set of estimated relationships for the agricultural sector. In this way it is possible to trace the effects of changes in the non-agricultural economy through the agricultural sector and in turn to make some estimates of the contribution of agriculture to the total. In estimating supply, demand and price relationships within agriculture twelve product categories are examined. This permits the results to be applied as forecasting devices for disaggregated commodity groups within agriculture. The results are not as gratifying as one would wish and consequently many of the relationships are being re-examined and re-estimated."], ["A Note on the Relationship Between Earning Expectations and New Car Purchases", "Is the probability of a new oar purchase greater among those spending units that expect to make more money than among those expecting to make less?

It is found that statistics of religious affiliation generally originate with the unstandardized records kept by clergymen or lay clerks in over 300,000 local churches, who are for the most part untrained. Officials of national religious bodies probably receive and publish reports from most local churches, but a considerable proportion of these officers make public official reports that are only their own estimates. Periodic compilations of \u201cthe latest information\u201d are noted. A brief summary of the U. S. Censuses of Religious Bodies is also made. A Church Distribution Study is described.

So also was change in stock. It was of two types: (1) units added by construction during the forties, and (2) change during the forties in the tenant stock of units in structures in existence in 1940. In addition, difference in the treatment of rent-free units in the two censuses had an important bearing on the rent change observed for rural nonfarm places. These factors account for a large part of the variation among places in the increase in rent paid between 1940 and 1950. The relationships observed indicate that the rent index was a fairly reliable measure of change in the monthly rent of dwellings of specified quality when allowance was made for the new-unit bias."], ["The Demand for Fertilizer in 1954: An Inter-State Study", " "], ["Maps Based on Probabilities", " "], ["Parameter Estimates and Autonomous Growth", " "], ["On the Problem of Matching Lists by Samples", "This paper presents theory for estimation of the proportions of names common to two or more lists of names, through use of samples drawn from the lists.
