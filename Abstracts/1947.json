Only the sample of households taken in the summer of 1946 is described in detail here. The 3052 sample households were drawn from a primary sample of about 200 areas. Villages, towns, and cities were classified on the basis of their 1940 populations, and a sample of areas and households was drawn, conforming closely to the principle of optimum allocation of resources and manpower. Geographic distribution was obtained automatically by drawing the areas at systematic intervals from the 1940 Census lists, which were arranged in geographic and alphabetic order. The sample gave an estimate of .988 for the ratio of the 1946 to the 1940 population, with a standard error of 2.1 percent. This ratio corresponds to a 1946 population of 7.26 \u00b1 .15 million. Numerous other population characteristics such as distribution by sex and age, literacy, and employment, and industry, were estimated and the standard errors were computed for some of them.

In general, the nonmunitions industries were less favorably situated than the munitions group. The post-reconversion period should be marked by unusually rapid increases in output per man-hour for many manufacturing industries as there is compensation for wartime restrictions.

The present analysis shows the nature of the relationship between those data and corresponding data on numbers of workers employed in Agriculture and numbers of persons available for employment. The series on supply and demand as per cent of normal seem to have reflected the farm labor situation fairly well. Supply as per cent of normal, as reported by farmers, seems to reflect the number of persons available for hire at current wage rates but not yet employed in agriculture.
