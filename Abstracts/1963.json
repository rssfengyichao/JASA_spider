The problem of combining price relatives of repeat sales of properties to obtain a price index can be converted into a regression problem, and standard techniques of regression analysis can be used to estimate the index. This method of estimation is more efficient than others for combining price relatives in that it utilizes information about the price index for earlier periods contained in sales prices in later periods.

Extending the fundamental Frisch-Waugh theorem concerning trend and regression analysis to encompass problems of seasonality facilitates the comparison of the implications of running regressions on data subjected to prior seasonal adjustment with the effects of including dummy variables with unadjusted data. Complicated types of moving seasonal patterns that may be handled by the dummy variable procedure are considered. Although efficient estimates of the parameters of the econometric model may be obtained in appropriate circumstances when data subjected to prior seasonal adjustment by the least squares procedure are employed, there is an inherent tendency to overstate the significance of the regression coefficients; a correction procedure is suggested. When seasonally adjusted data are employed, certain special complications must be taken into account in applying Aitken's generalized least squares procedure in order to deal with autocorrelated residuals.

Migration expectancy differs basically from life expectancy because migration is a recurrent type of event but a person can die only once. Illustrative migration expectancies for the United States show that a person born in 1958 had an expectancy of 12.99 moves to a different house and 4.17 moves to a different county during his remaining lifetime. A person at age 20 could expect to move to a different house 9.26 times during the rest of his life. Additional expectancies are presented by sex, employment status, marital status, and occupation.

The compliance score for interest received on bank time deposits was much lower. While both studies showed that compliance increased as the size of the recipient's income rose, only the latter study showed this relationship between compliance and size of interest payment.
