In this paper is presented a method of determining the probability of a hit within a given circle when it is assumed that the guidance error is distributed according to a bivariate normal distribution. This problem can be solved readily if the random error variables are independently distributed along two orthogonal axes with equal standard deviations and if they are not biased relative to the target location. Since these assumptions often are not valid, a series solution to the general problem is provided with an analysis of the error introduced by considering only a finite number of the terms."], ["A Sequential Test of the Equality of Probabilities in a Multinomial Distribution", "For testing the hypothesis that all the categories in a multinomial distribution are equally likely, a sequential test is proposed which at each stage of the sampling observes whether the observation falls in the set of categories containing the largest number of earlier observations.

For two-sided intervals, many other possibilities are available. One purpose of this paper is to call attention to these additional possibilities, and to discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The principal purpose, however, is to show how to construct specialized two-sided tolerance intervals for use in investigating situations of two types. For the first situation, the probability concentration in the central part of the population is investigated. For the other, it is desired to investigate the probability concentration about a specified point. In both situations, the specialized intervals presented are not difficult to apply. For the first situation, permissible additional information can be used to obtain intervals tending to have shorter lengths than those not exploiting this extra information. In the other situation, the relative emphasis placed on the part of the interval to one side of the specified point, as compared to the part on the other side, can be specified."], ["A Multi-Stage Procedure for the Selection of the Best of Several Populations", "This paper proposes a multi-stage procedure for the selection of the best of several populations, allowing more observations to be made on the more successful treatments.

They have certain technical advantages over other residual methods, specifically the exclusive virtue of a built-in technique which corrects for net census undercount by age, including underenumeration and misstatements of age. Using three sets of estimated \u201cclosed\u201d native populations and reported United States deaths as standards, this study evaluates three sets of national census survival rates. The unavailability of appropriate figures make it impossible to determine precisely which is most accurate. Then, it analyzes the effects of adjusting census survival rates for national-state mortality differentials in measuring intercensal net migration and deaths for states. Next it examines differences in state net migration and mortality arising from the use of the forward, reverse, and average formulas. The study finds insignificant differences between adjusted and unadjusted survival rates and among the forward, reverse, and average formulas. Finally, it estimates net interstate migration for native whites, total whites, and nonwhites, by age and sex, for the 1940\u201350 decade, using census survival rates, and compares the results with the more correct estimates for all ages obtained with vital statistics data.
