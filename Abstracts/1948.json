When interaction exists, estimation of the magnitudes of main effects and interactions requires an arbitrary definition of what constitutes a main effect. Whether the class frequencies be equal, proportionate, or disproportionate, the definition must conform to the use that is to be made of the results and must not be dependent merely on the convenience of an analysis of variance."], ["A Test for Symmetry in Contingency Tables", null], ["The War Production Board's Statistical Reporting Experience", "Effective wartime administration of the industrial system required the use of a common factual language with which government and industry could communicate. No such system existed in the prewar period. An effort to develop a suitable quantitive language was begun early in the war, and met with some of the most difficult problems encountered by wartime management. Although substantial progress was made, a stabilized and commonly understood system of communication was never attained. This article discusses some of the outstanding problems in connection with questionnaire units of measure and terminology. An analysis of the development of material and product classification and terminology is followed by a discussion of the methods employed to standardize concepts relating to general terminology in questionnaire instructions, to units of measure, to reporting time periods and to end-product usage."], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Significance of Inventories in the Current Economic Situation", " "], ["Measuring Physical Inventories", " "], ["On the Determination of Sample Sizes in Designing Experiments", " "], ["Application of the Theory of Extreme Values in Fracture Problems", " "], ["Problems with Sampling Procedures for Reserve Valuations", " "], ["Recent Developments in Graduation and Interpolation", " "], ["Sampling Errors in Mortality and Other Statistics in Life Insurance", " "], ["The Edge-Marking Method of Analyzing Data", "About thirty years ago the writer introduced a simple card method of analyzing data. The method has been used by many students and others. It is especially adapted to problems with experimental populations of not more than about four hundred cases in which it is desired to analyze the relations of a large number of attributes. The number of attributes can be rather extensive, up to three hundred if necessary. The writer's 5 by 8 cards for edge-marking have been reprinted many times. Most of the users of these cards are familiar with only one or two applications. The purpose of this paper is to describe enough examples to illustrate the versatility of the edge-marking method."], ["The War Production Board's Statistical Reporting Experience, II and III", "An understanding of the scope of the WPB reporting structure demands more than a knowledge of its development as described in the first article of this series.
