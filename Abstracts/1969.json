Comparisons of working life tables for Ghana and other industrialized countries such as the United States, England and Wales are made. In addition, some aspects of the uses of working life tables are considered, particularly the examination of annual losses from the actual working population and the factors determining the pattern of losses. It was estimated that out of the total number who left the working population of Ghana in 1960, 89.9% left on account of death and only 10.1% left on account of causes other than death. The total loss rate for Ghana in 1960 amounted to 23.3 per 1000 male working population; made up of rates 20.9 per 1000 for losses due to death and 2.4 per 1000 for losses due to retirement and other causes respectively."], ["Some Stochastic Versions of the Matrix Model for Population Dynamics", "The first model seems unsatisfactory as demographic theory, while the second does not account for the observed imprecision of population projections.

This paper investigates the conduct of such a trial where the \u201cPlay the Winner Rule\u201d (PWR) is used to assign patients to the different therapies. The implementation of the PWR in a clinical trial tends to place more patients on the better treatment. Both theoretical and numerical investigations show that over a wide range of situations this rule leads to near optimum results when used in a two-stage manner. Furthermore, these results are insensitive to optimum sample size requirements."], ["The Multiple Sample Up-and-Down Method in Bioassay", null], ["A Solution to the Problem of Linking Multivariate Documents", "Section 1 identifies three document linkage problems.
