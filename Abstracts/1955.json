A number of random type disturbances that cause aeronautical problems are described and some of their effects on the airplane indicated. Particular attention is given to the effects of atmospheric turbulence in giving rise to airplane loads and structural stresses. The general approach used in calculating airplane responses to random disturbances by means of power spectra techniques is then described. As a concrete illustration, some results obtained in a study of missile behavior in rough-air flight are presented. An effort is also made to indicate some unsolved statistical problems that are encountered in these applications."], ["Use of the Range Instead of the Standard Deviation", "Many standard test and estimation procedures require the computation of the sample standard deviation.

A composite estimation procedure has been introduced which reduces the sampling variability for most estimates. Also, there has been a considerable reduction in the variance of variance estimates made from the sample. A statistical quality control program has been introduced to help insure results of consistently acceptable quality. Problems arose in the process of shifting from one design to the other that resulted in some significant differences between the new and old samples for a few of the estimates, especially unemployment.
