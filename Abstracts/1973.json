Here, the method of unweighted means is examined with regard to estimating the variance components for a two-way classification with unequal numbers of observations in the cells and with one or more cells having no observations. In particular, two estimating procedures based upon the method of unweighted means are developed to estimate the variance components for a design with missing cells.

These degrees of freedom are further reduced by the number of parameters appearing in the inter-block information. However, some parameters also appear in the intra-block information, and thus allow two independent estimators. The difference of these two estimators provides additional information about the inter-block variance. This paper shows how this extra information may be recovered to improve tests of hypotheses concerning inter-block parameters."], ["On the Augmentation Procedure in Singular Weighing Designs", "In [1], the problem of singular weighing designs was cast in the framework of a reflexive generalized inverse, and it was shown how a singular design could be augmented to secure maximized efficiency.
