Despite many recent improvements, census data present numerous problems of quality, comparability, detail, and area classification of data, particularly in studies involving area sub-divisions of standard metropolitan areas or temporal comparisons. Among the needed improvements are (1) better coordination of the area units of statistical reporting, (2) reconstruction of historical series of metropolitan population and economic data, and (3) fuller recognition of metropolitan population as a distinctive residential category."], ["Measuring Spatial Association with Special Consideration of the Case of Market Orientation of Production", null], ["Practical Value of International Educational Statistics", null], ["Regression Techniques Applied to Seasonal Corrections and Adjustments for Calendar Shifts", " "], ["The Ranking of Variances in Normal Populations", " "], ["The Condition for Lot Size Production", " "], ["Distributions Possessing a Monotone Likelihood Ratio", null], ["Quadratic Extrapolation and a Related Test of Hypotheses", " "], ["Corrigenda", null], ["Statistical Abstracts", null], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Publications Received", null], ["The Optimum Strategy in Blackjack", "The \u201coptimum strategy\u201d determined by the above analysis differs substantially from the published strategies of card experts and the usual style of play in the casinos."], ["Two Sequential Tests Against Trend", " "], ["Equivalence of Two Estimates of Product Variance", null], ["The Economics of the President's Economic Reports", " "], ["Analytical Graduation of Fertility Rates", null], ["Asymptotic Efficiencies of a Nonparametric Life Test for Smaller Percentiles of a Gamma Distribution", "This paper does not present new statistical methods. Rather, it shows that a well known nonparametric procedure which is valid under extremely general conditions also has high efficiency and other favorable properties for certain types of life testing situations. This nonparametric method is the sign test and its confidence interval and point estimate analogs. Sign test procedures and methods of applying them have already received extensive coverage in the literature (e.g., [2]). Consequently, in this paper emphasis is placed on fields of application instead of on methods of application. However, the basic methods for obtaining tests, confidence intervals, and point estimates of the sign test type are restated for convenience. The properties investigated are concerned with the estimation and testing of smaller population percentage points for the case of a sample from a gamma probability distribution. The investigations show that appropriate use of the sign test type of nonparametric tests and estimates sometimes can yield a saving in cost or time without loss of statistical efficiency, since the experiment can be stopped when only a fraction of the items being life tested have failed. The nonparametric results are found to be highly efficient compared to the \u201cbest\u201d parametric results based on the same fraction of items failed for the case of small population percentage points; this conclusion appears to be valid for any sample size and for any reasonable type of statistical population."], ["Estimates of Bounded Relative Error for the Ratio of Variances of Normal Distributions", null], ["Machine Computation of Higher Moments", "An efficient method is presented for the economical and rapid computation of as many as six to twelve moments from a single run of the tabulating cards through the IBM Accounting Machine Type 402.
