Some contributing factors to lack of inspection efficiency are noted, and an analysis of the validity of the guarantees of the plans in the presence of inspection error is made."], ["Elasticity of Physical Quantities and Flexibility of Unit Prices in the Dimension of Time", "When the interaction of the physical quantities and the unit prices of a given commodity is marked by regularities over time, whether in the recurrence of cyclical or seasonal patterns or in the persistence of secular relations, it is convenient to define the differential movement of quantity with respect to price by a coefficient of elasticity, of price with respect to quantity by a coefficient of flexibility. These are mathematically identical with the familiar coefficients of Marshall and Moore, but in this usage they relate to designated temporal frameworks. The examples presented in the present paper deal with price-quantity interrelations in business cycles, in specific cycles in physical quantities, in specific cycles in unit prices, and in homogeneous secular periods. No attempt is made to eliminate or hold constant the dynamic influences that play upon the market. In each case we seek to measure the differential responsiveness of the quantity and price factors to the various impinging forces that operate within the temporal framework in question. If there are persistent regularities in the operation of these forces, appropriately designated coefficients of elasticity and flexibility can serve as useful instruments in the analysis of economic change."], ["Presenting Seasonal Variation to the Business Executive", "In presenting the results of their analysis, business statisticians have failed to reach the full understanding of the average business executive.

Because order of birth and parity of mother were ignored, these rates have had an upward bias in some years and a downward bias in others. The omission of an allowance for marriage and fecundity has had a similar effect. The reasons for these biases are analyzed; a method for utilizing age-parity specific rates and allowing for spinsterhood and sterility is described; and the different types of rates are shown for selected years."], ["The Problem of Non-Response in Sample Surveys", "In a mathematical appendix the general formulas are derived."], ["On the Economic Theory of Cost of Living Index Numbers", null], ["The Computation of Partial Correlation Coefficients", null], ["An Application of Sequential Sampling to Testing Students", "This paper provides an illustration of an application to the field of education of a technique hitherto used mainly in industry.

In problems of this sort standard sampling plans are impractical because of the excessively large sample sizes required. In this paper we consider the statistical questions involved in developing an efficient sampling plan for such problems, and recommend a procedure which has been found very useful in biological assay and in the testing of explosives. There is good reason to believe that the same statistical techniques can also be used in many other fields in which one is interested in studying the response of objects tested as a function of the strength of the stimuli to which they are subjected."], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Letters about Books", null], ["Editorial Board Page", "This article has no abstract"], ["One Statistical World", null], ["Objectives, Uses and Types of Labor Force Data in Relation to Economic Policy", "Labor force statistics include data obtained from employing establishments, registrations, and population surveys, with each type having advantage for certain types of uses. Labor force data from population surveys need to be expanded to provide differentiated categories of the unemployed and to identify those employed workers whose employment is inadequate because it is insufficient in amount or is remunerated at substandard rates.

This accounts in part for the shortcomings of many forecasts made last summer. Five suggestions concerning forecasting are offered for consideration: (1) that consumption in any particular period be estimated after close study of the prospects for component parts, with income after taxes being regarded as only one (very important) factor influencing consumption; (2) that more attention be given to accurate measurement of the current level of the physical volume of consumption as a starting point for estimating future changes in consumption; (3) that the common assumptions about constant prices be modified to suit the occasion and that the whole approach to the problem of estimating the probable course of consumption, income, employment, and prices be re-examined and revised to take adequate account of all the important factors in the market; (4) that very real limits to what can be accomplished in forecasting by describing the economic world in terms of mathematical relationships be recognized and that the importance of selective judgments with respect to particular periods be emphasized; and (5) that, in view of the present uncertain state of the art of forecasting, care should be taken in formulating policy to rely only so far as is necessary on forecasts arrived at by any method."], ["The Use of Adjusting Factors in the Analysis of Data with Disproportionate Subclass Numbers", "The method is based upon the assumption that the weighted sum of squares of the subclass means that are adjusted for the border mean effects is an efficient estimate of the variance due to interaction. Justification of this assumption is indicated by the fact that the difference between the differences of subclass means for a given classification is unchanged by the adjusting process. It is further demonstrated that if a sufficient number of adjustings are carried out the results will be the same as those obtained by the method of fitting constants."], ["A Punched Card Method for Presenting, Analyzing, and Comparing Many Series of Statistics for Areas", "Information about small areas such as census tracts, wards, cities, counties, etc., should be available to the consumer in a compact readable form. To meet the problem of multitudinous tables in large expensive volumes, the method described below was devised for the analysis and publication of data concerning the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. By using punched card procedures, making use of summary cards, machine multiplication and other techniques, a set of cards was prepared containing the social characteristics of each area and including percentile rankings identifying the relative position of each area for a particular characteristic. The statistical tables were reproduced directly from the listing sheets. Instead of repeating identical heading stubs for each of the tables, one set of stubs was printed on overlapping tab cards bound to the right side of the book. This alone makes for a most efficient use of paper and reduces the size and cost of the books.

Solutions of two somewhat different sampling problems are discussed. One is designed simply to provide a sample estimate (average or sum) for any desired factor over a period of time. The other, with little loss of efficiency, provides a sample estimate for each of a series of short time units making up the period, as well as an estimate for the period as a whole.
