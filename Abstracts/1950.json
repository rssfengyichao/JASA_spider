Low earnings are associated with high propensities to engage in the labor force. The variation in labor-force participation is greater among females than among males in the large cities of the United States. This study points out that high female labor-force participation rates are found in communities in which large numbers of jobs suitable for women are found in textile, apparel, tobacco, and electrical machinery manufacturing. Conversely, low labor-force participation among women is found in communities in which the dominant industries are iron and steel, machinery, automobile, and basic rubber manufacturing.

Then the death of one person may result in several units of \u201cdeath\u201d with respect to the investigation; moreover, the number of units per individual may vary noticeably. Thus the usual large sample methods of obtaining significance tests and confidence intervals for the true value of the mortality rate are not applicable to these situations. If the number of units associated with each person in the investigation were known, accurate large sample results could be obtained; however, determination of the number of units associated with each individual would require an extremely large amount of work. This article presents some valid large sample tests and confidence intervals for the mortality rate which do not require much work and are reasonably efficient.

When only a single chosen component is to be maximized relative to a set of other components, the equations are linear. In the case discussed here we have a two-way table of non-numerical observational data where the solution of equations of higher degree is required. Appropriate values are to be determined in order that the observations may be made as additive as possible.
