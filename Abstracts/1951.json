If the purpose is utility, then the score for each forecast should be directly proportional to the value of the forecast in meeting specified operational requirements. If skill is the purpose, then the total score for a series of forecasts should be a reflection of the forecaster's ability to analyze and classify a weather situation for forecasting purposes; within a well-defined class of antecedent weather the probability of a subsequent event, like rain, is increased above (or decreased below) the relative frequency of that event in the total of all weather situations, as established in a long period of time."], ["Statistics in Production and Inspection", null], ["Some Statistical Problems in Small Group Research", null], ["Relations between Prices, Consumption, and Production", null], ["Actuarial Science\u2014A Survey of Theoretical Developments", null], ["National Income: Status and Prospects as Seen by an Estimator", null], ["Statistical Measurement and Economic Mobilization Planning", null], ["A Large-Sample Test of the Hypothesis that one of two Random Variables is Stochastically Larger than the Other", null], ["The Distribution of the Range in Samples from a Discrete Rectangular Population", null], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Editorial Board Page", "This article has no abstract"], ["Response Errors in Surveys", null], ["A Critical Analysis of Farm Employment Estimates", null], ["Estimating Parameters of Logarithmic-Normal Distributions by Maximum Likelihood", "This paper is concerned with the three-parameter logarithmic normal distribution; i.e., the general distribution in which the terminus is unknown.
