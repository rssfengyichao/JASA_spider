The variables actually used in credit scoring are usually, however, qualitative occurring as high/low, or present/ absent. We present a nonparametric approach to the credit screening problem. In our method we do not assume multivariate normality nor do we apply any arbitrary scaling procedures to the qualitative variables. We classify an observation to that group with which it has most in common, this being done so as to minimize expected loss from misclassification. It is a variant of the \u201cclosest neighbor\u201d rule. The misclassification probabilities of our screening rule are obtained by a jack-knife method. An empirical method for the selection of variates for screening is also given. The possibilities for adopting the method to an on-line computer system is discussed with an illustrative example."], ["Note on the Cochran Q Test", null], ["Estimation of Heteroscedastic Variances in Linear Models", null], ["Covariance Matrix Estimation in Linear Models", "In regression analysis with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors, the usual assumption is that the covariance matrix \u03c3 of the errors is completely specified, except perhaps for a scalar multiplier. This condition is relaxed in this paper by assuming only that \u03c3 has a certain pattern; for example, that \u03c3 is diagonal or partitionable into a diagonal matrix of sub-matrices. The method used for estimating \u03c3 is the standard procedure of equating certain quadratic forms of the observations (in this case, squares and products of residuals from regression) to their expectations, and solving for the unknown variances and covariances. A numerical example illustrates the method."], ["Testing Overidentifying Restrictions When the Disturbances are Small", "Natural test statistics for the hypothesis that an equation is overidentified have been developed by Anderson and Rubin and by Basmann. If the disturbances are jointly normal, serially uncorrected, and small, both the above overidentification test statistics have the Fisher variance-ratio distribution asymptotically as the variance of the error terms gets small. This gives an analytic explanation of Monte Carlo results of Basmann. The results given apply to linear models in which predetermined variables are exogenous."], ["Estimation of Seemingly Unrelated Regressions with Autoregressive Disturbances", "Joint estimation of a system of linear regression equations with mutually correlated disturbances leads, in general, to more efficient estimates than estimation of each equation separately. A method of joint estimation developed by Arnold Zeller on the assumption that the disturbances are non-autocorrelated has recently been adapted by Richard Parks for the case in which this assumption does not hold. In the present article we develop several alternative estimators and compare their small-sample efficiency.

Although sampling errors for the multiplicity survey are not necessarily smaller than those for the conventional survey in which sample households report for their own residents only, in most instances it should be feasible to assure a substantial reduction in sampling error by selecting appropriate multiplicity rules. Using alternative statistical models, it is demonstrated that under specified conditions, sampling errors for the multiplicity survey are necessarily smaller than those for the conventional survey, and the results give insight regarding the factors contributing to the efficiency of the multiplicity survey."], [null, null], ["Canonical Association between Nominal Measurements", "The problem of the measurement of association between two attributes is of importance in social sciences [5].

A new model is developed and its performance compared with a model proposed by Rao and Kupper. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are found using an iterative procedure which, under a weak assumption, converges monotonically to the solution of the likelihood equations. It is noted that for a balanced paired comparison experiment the ranking obtained from the maximum likelihood estimates agrees with that obtained from a scoring system which allots two points for a win, one for a tie and zero for a loss. The likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis of equal preferences is shown to have the same asymptotic efficiency as that for the Rao-Kupper model. Two examples are presented, one of which introduces a set of data for an unbalanced paired comparison experiment.

As an example, the lower bound is obtained for the reliability of a \u201ctwo out of three\u201d system in which each component has an exponential life length and an exponential repair time.

The development of the technique essentially involves determining, by successive approximations, a function which serves as the test criterion.
