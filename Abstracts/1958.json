The usual index takes account only of the direction of change of the components. An experiment was under-taken to determine if the behavior of a diffusion index of employment would be affected when it was weighted to allow for the size of the component industries, the amplitudes of the individual fluctuations, or the combined influence of size and amplitude. Size weighting made little difference, because the average size of industries in the expanding and contracting groups remained fairly constant despite substantial fluctuations over time in the number of industries contained in the two groups. Amplitude weighting exaggerated the month-to-month movements of the unweighted index, because the forces which made for an increase of diffusion also tended both to amplify the average increases in rising industries and to dampen the average declines in falling industries.
