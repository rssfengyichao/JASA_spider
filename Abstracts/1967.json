The latter can be estimated directly from the list or from a sub-sample drawn from it, by the application of Goodman's [2] results concerning the estimation of the number of classes in a population. The outcome probabilities can then be evaluated by considering the incoming record as randomly drawn from the list, if it should match some item on the list, and as added to the list, to form a new list with approximately the same classification probabilities, if it ought to match no item on the list.

Greater attention is given to measures related to the Gini-Lorenz concentration curve; but while the \u2018between states\u2019 concentration curve could be defined in an interesting manner, the \u2018within states\u2019 component could not be defined with equal success."], ["Measures of Concentration", "This paper discusses measures of industry concentration\u2014the concentration ratio, the Herfindahl index and a new measure developed by the authors\u2014both analytically and empirically. The analytical analysis consists of developing a set of properties which we argue all measures of concentration should possess. Although the concentration ratio is shown to be deficient on analytical grounds it appears to yield estimates of concentration not too different from the Herfindahl index and the measure devised by the authors."], ["Some Further Notes on Disturbance Estimates in Regression Analysis", "An important check on the computations of these estimates is given, as well as a comparison of these estimates with the commonly used least-squares estimates. For some special cases the BLUS estimates are analytically derived. The BLUS estimates are important for research workers who deal with time series because these estimates can be used to test auto-correlation among the disturbances."], ["Wilcoxon Confidence Intervals for Location Parameters in the Discrete Case", "The paper surveys results about the behavior of nonparametric methods in cases where the customary continuity assumptions are not satisfied. A projection approach is used to show that true confidence coefficients associated with confidence intervals for appropriate location parameters derived from Wilcoxon one- and two-sample tests are at least equal to the nominal level for the continuous case, if the confidence intervals are considered closed, at most equal to the nominal level, if they are considered open. The results are interpreted in terms of tests of hypotheses."], ["A Partial Coefficient for Goodman and Kruskal's Gamma", null], ["Ties in Paired-Comparison Experiments: A Generalization of the Bradley-Terry Model", null], ["Sequences Balanced for Pairs of Residual Effects", "Finney and Outhwaite [2] introduced serially balanced sequences into the statistical literature. They classified these sequences into two types, viz., type I and type II. Sampford [3] gave many methods of construction and analysis of these sequences. But these authors were concerned only with sequences balanced for a single residual. We shall deal with sequences balanced for pairs of residual effects. Two important methods of construction of these sequences are given. One is from designs balanced for residuals within blocks and the other from \u201cround table solutions.\u201d The analysis of the sequence is given with a numerical example. The appendix contains the plans of five sequences for four to eight treatments. Experimenters who are interested in the practical application of these sequences need go only through parts 1 and 4, conclusion and the appendix. For, part 1 explains where the sequences are to be used, part 4 gives the analysis of these sequences and explains its limitations, the conclusion points out a minor advantage of the SSBS over the SBS, and the appendix contains the plans of some sequences."], ["Equal and Proportional Frequency Squares", null], ["The Combination of Estimates from Similar Experiments, Allowing for Inter-Experiment Variation", "A series of similar experiments may give, with not necessarily the same precision, estimates which vary among themselves from experiment to experiment. Methods are described of using the maximum likelihood equations to obtain estimates of the overall mean and the variance components, and good approximations to them. The procedures are particularly useful in bioassay."], ["A Note on Regression in the Multivariate Poisson Distribution", null], ["Distributions of Some Statistics in Samples from Exponential and Power-Function Populations", null], [null, null], [null, null], ["Note on a Uniqueness Relation in Certain Accident Proneness Models", "It is shown that the uniqueness of relationship between a regression function and a prior distribution, in Bates-Neyman type models, previously established for linear regressions and gamma prior distributions, is of much more general application."], ["Book Reviews", null], ["Editorial Board Page", "This article has no abstract"]]}
