The special feature of the situation considered in this paper is that after the decision to stop observation is made a fixed number of additional observations are available for the terminal decision. The test is then based on the ratio of the likelihoods (at two simple hypotheses) of all the observations (whatever stopping rule is used).

The joint application of these two methods facilitates the estimation of more of the parameters of the mathematical model than any one of the methods would permit. Estimators are developed for several of the parameters and their biases are derived. Empirical results are presented on the basis of a study which was undertaken in connection with the 1961 Census of Population (Canada), and which involved the inter-penetration of 67 pairs of enumerators' assignments followed by switching the assignments and re-enumeration.

Imposition of erroneous estimable linear restrictions is shown to lower variances of estimators if and only if it biases them. All these results rely heavily on the use of the generalized inverse of a matrix, for which a new proof of existence and uniqueness is presented from the viewpoint of duality in linear spaces.

The findings, based on the period 1950\u20131961, support the view suggested by several American studies that stability of residence is characteristic of a large majority of the population. Stability is most typical of the young and the older age groups and least common among those 25\u201344 years of age, both male and female. But even for the middle age range, at least 70 per cent of the population was stable. The findings also emphasize that the pattern of repeated mobility is most characteristic of a limited segment of the population, a group which shows a particularly strong tendency to move several times over relatively short time spans. This pattern is particularly characteristic of those in the 25\u201344 year age group. These data emphasize, therefore, that a high degree of residential stability for most of the population is not at all contradictory with high rates of mobility The repeated moves of a small segment of the population inflate the overall mobility rates well beyond what they would be if mobility were based on the number of migrants instead of on the number of moves."], ["Criteria for Best Substitute Interval Estimators, with an Application to the Normal Distribution", "The following criteria for determining best substitute interval estimators of a given class for a population parameter are considered in this paper: (1) minimizing the expected length of the confidence interval (maximizing the effectiveness); (2) minimizing the sum of the mean (absolute) deviations of the upper and lower confidence bounds from the true value (maximizing the effectivity); and (3) minimizing the sum of the mean squared deviations of the upper and lower confidence bounds from the true value (maximizing the efficiency). Modified forms of these criteria can also be applied to one-sided confidence intervals. Both theoretical and practical reasons are given for preferring criterion (3) to the others.
