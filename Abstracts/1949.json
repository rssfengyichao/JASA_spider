Such criteria have three purposes. First, they would rank the candidate languages by familiarity and excellence. Second, they would diagnose weaknesses in each candidate: from this diagnosis a living language could be simplified towards the ideal regularity of an artificial language, while preserving more of familiarity to the world's population than an artificial language possesses.
