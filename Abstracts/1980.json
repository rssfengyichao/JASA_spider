A Fourier expansion is found to be usually more expeditious than a Hermite expansion but a compromise is useful. The best fit to the scattering data has 13 bumps, all of which are evaluated by the Bayesian interpretation of the method. Eight bumps are well supported.

Asymptotic power properties of the statistic and its components in testing symmetry about the origin against location shift alternatives when observations have double exponential or normal distributions are described. From these power considerations, it is suggested that the first component is a more useful statistic for the testing problem than the overall Cram\u00e9r-von Mises-type statistic.

Further, least squares is the most biased and maintains the Gauss-Markov property of minimum variance. The large bias of least squares, however, more than offsets the small variance, so that least squares exhibits the largest mean squares of the four estimators.
